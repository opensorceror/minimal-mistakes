Finally, after months (years?) of procrastinating, I have set up my own *real* blog! 

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
"Hello, world!"
```

This blog was previously located on [branded.me](https://branded.me/harshgadgil/posts). Although I love how branded.me has made it a piece of cake for anyone to start their own blog, to me, it didn't feel very flexible and *programmer-friendly*.

Embarrassingly, one of the main reasons for my marathon procrastination was because I had never heard of text transformation engines such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I thought there were only two main ways to create blogs:

- Using a blogging system such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) or branded.me
- Building a blogging website using vanilla HTML and CSS

Using WordPress was too limiting for a programmer, and writing every blog post in vanilla HTML felt like needless effort.

That was until I stumbled upon Jekyll. I'm very impressed, and I'm usually not so easily impressed. Setting up this blog has *not* been easy, but it has been fun! Jekyll is incredibly powerful, and I'm going to enjoy blogging using Markdown!
